## 1. Project name and introduction
To address the inconsistency between the classification and regression branches in object detection, we proposed DCH and SHL (see our paper for details). Our implementation is built on the MMDetection framework. We have provided the relevant Python files, which can be adapted according to the frameworkâ€™s requirements.
